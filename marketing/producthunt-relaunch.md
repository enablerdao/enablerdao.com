### Elio - Offline AI for iPhone

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → Why Now → How It Works → Traction → Offer → Personal Story → Ask

**Word Count**: 750 words

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Yuki, and I built Elio – a fully offline AI assistant for iPhone. No internet required, no data sent to servers, zero API costs.

**The Problem**

Every time you ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini a question, your data goes to remote servers. They promise not to train on it, but you're still trusting a third party with potentially sensitive information.

I wanted an AI I could truly trust. One where I could ask about medical symptoms, financial planning, or personal struggles without worrying about data leaks or breaches.

The solution seemed obvious: run the AI entirely on-device. But there was a catch.

**The Challenge**

Large language models typically require powerful GPUs and gigabytes of RAM. How do you fit that on an iPhone?

I spent 6 months solving this:

1. **Model Selection**: Tested 20+ models, settled on Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3.5-mini with 4-bit quantization. Small enough to fit in iPhone memory, capable enough to be useful.

2. **Speed Optimization**: Used Metal Performance Shaders, KV cache optimization, and speculative decoding. Went from 45s per response to 15-20s.

3. **Memory Management**: iOS kills memory-heavy apps aggressively. Implemented lazy loading, automatic backgrounding, and careful buffer management.

4. **User Experience**: Added streaming responses, progressive loading, and background pre-warming so it feels instant.

**How It Works**

Elio ships with pre-quantized GGUF models (1.8GB total) bundled in the app. Everything runs on-device using Metal-accelerated inference.

When you ask a question:
- Tokenized with SentencePiece
- Model generates response token-by-token
- Streamed to UI in real-time
- Full conversation stored locally in CoreData

You can disable all network permissions in iOS Settings and Elio still works perfectly.

**Why Now**

Two things made this possible in 2024:

1. **Model Compression**: Techniques like quantization, distillation, and pruning have made 3B models nearly as good as 7B models from a year ago.

2. **iPhone Performance**: The A16/A17 chips are insanely powerful. They can run LLM inference faster than many laptops.

On-device AI is finally practical.

**What You Can Do**

Elio is great for:
- Code generation and debugging
- Brainstorming ideas
- Answering questions
- Language translation
- Summarizing text

It struggles with:
- Very specialized knowledge
- Complex multi-step reasoning
- Long context (current limit: 4K tokens)

It's not GPT-4, but for 90% of queries, it's good enough. And it's 100% private.

**Traction**

Soft-launched 2 weeks ago:
- 500 downloads
- 4.8★ rating on App Store (50 reviews)
- Featured in "Apps We Love" (Japan)
- $2,500 revenue (one-time purchase, no subscriptions)

**Product Hunt Exclusive**

For the PH community, Elio is 50% off today only. Use code **PRODUCTHUNT** at checkout.

Normally $4.99 → Today $2.49

**Why I Built This**

I'm a software engineer who's always been paranoid about privacy. I tape over my webcam, use VPNs, avoid Google, the whole nine yards.

But I also love AI. The productivity boost is real. I use Claude for coding, writing, learning new topics.

The cognitive dissonance was killing me. How do I use AI without sacrificing privacy?

Elio is my answer. It's the AI assistant I've always wanted: powerful, private, and mine.

**What's Next**

Roadmap based on beta feedback:
- Larger models (7B) for Pro devices
- Voice input/output (also offline)
- Function calling / tool use
- iPad optimization
- iCloud sync (end-to-end encrypted)

I'm here all day to answer questions, hear feedback, and chat about on-device AI. Fire away!

### ChatWeb - AI with Agentic Tools

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Agentic Mode → Tech Deep-Dive → Traction → Offer → Ask

**Word Count**: 800 words

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Yuki, maker of ChatWeb – an AI assistant that can actually *do* things, not just talk about them.

**The Problem**

ChatGPT and Claude are great conversationalists, but they're stuck in their training data. Ask about current events, and they apologize. Ask them to run code, and they give you a snippet to copy-paste.

I wanted an AI that could:
- Search the web for real-time info
- Execute code to verify solutions
- Read/write files to persist work
- Chain multiple tools together to solve complex tasks

**The Solution**

ChatWeb combines conversational AI with 15+ built-in tools:

**Core Tools**:
- `web_search` – Google/Bing search with real-time results
- `web_fetch` – Fetch and parse any URL
- `code_execute` – Run Python/JavaScript/Bash in sandbox
- `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_list` – Persistent filesystem
- `calculator` – Arbitrary precision math
- `weather` – Current conditions anywhere
- `image_generate` – DALL-E 3 integration
- `image_analyze` – Vision model for uploads

**What Makes It Different: Agentic Mode**

Most AI assistants are single-step. You ask, they answer. Done.

ChatWeb can *plan* and *iterate*. When you enable agentic mode:

1. You ask: "Find the cheapest 4K monitor on Kakaku.com and calculate price with tax"
2. ChatWeb plans: "I'll need to search → fetch product page → extract price → calculate"
3. Iteration 1: `web_search("4K monitor Kakaku")` → gets URLs
4. Iteration 2: `web_fetch(product_url)` → extracts price
5. Iteration 3: `calculator(price * 1.1)` → applies tax
6. Returns final answer with full breakdown

All streamed via Server-Sent Events with real-time progress.

**How It Works**

Built on a custom Rust backend (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB) with multi-provider load balancing:

**Models**:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default, strongest reasoning)
- GPT-4o (balanced)
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (fastest)
- Llama 3.3 70B (code specialist)
- Qwen 2.5 Coder (local fallback, zero cost)

Each tool is sandboxed:
- Code runs in `/tmp/sandbox/{session_id}` with 10s timeout
- No network access (Lambda VPC isolation)
- Auto-cleanup after session expires

**Tech Deep-Dive**

The hardest part was tool calling across providers. Each AI has different function calling schemas:

- OpenAI: `tools` array + `tool_choice`
- Anthropic: Same structure, different semantics
- Gemini: Completely different schema

I built a normalization layer that translates to/from a canonical format. This lets me:
- Add new providers in <100 lines
- Swap models without changing tool definitions
- Load-balance across 10+ API keys with auto-failover

**Challenges**

1. **Web Search from Lambda**: Google/Bing block AWS IPs. Solution: SerpAPI for search + Jina Reader for fetching (renders JS, strips ads).

2. **Multi-Iteration Loops**: Knowing when to stop is tricky. Pass tools too long → infinite loop. Stop too early → task incomplete. Current heuristic works 90% of the time.

3. **Cost Control**: Each tool call = another LLM round-trip. Agentic mode burns credits fast. Implemented credit limits per plan.

**Traction**

Launched 2 months ago:
- 500+ users signed up
- 15,000+ messages sent
- $200 MRR (early!)
- Featured on BetaList, Indie Hackers

**Product Hunt Exclusive**

Use code **PRODUCTHUNT** for 2000 free credits (≈2000 messages or 200 agentic tasks).

No credit card required. Just sign up at chatweb.ai and enter the code.

**Pricing**

Free: 100 credits, 1 tool iteration
Starter: $9/mo, 1K credits, 3 iterations
Pro: $29/mo, 10K credits, 5 iterations

**Why I Built This**

I'm a software engineer who uses AI every day for coding, research, and learning. But I kept hitting walls:

- "What's the weather in Tokyo?" → ChatGPT: "I can't access real-time data."
- "Run this Python script and show output" → Copy-paste to terminal.
- "Find cheapest hotel in Kyoto for next weekend" → Manual search.

I wanted an AI that could just... do it. No manual steps, no copy-paste, no "I can't do that."

ChatWeb is that AI.

**What's Next**

Roadmap:
- Memory/RAG (upload docs, ChatWeb remembers)
- Multi-agent collaboration (specialist agents)
- Voice interface (already have STT/TTS working)
- Browser extension (chat with current page)
- Developer API

I'm here all day to answer questions about the tech, agentic reasoning, or anything else. Let's chat!

### News.xyz - Personalized AI Newsletter

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Privacy → Traction → Offer → Personal Story → Ask

**Word Count**: 700 words

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Yuki, and I built News.xyz – an AI-powered newsletter that generates personalized news summaries based on topics you actually care about.

**The Problem**

I subscribe to 20+ newsletters: Benedict Evans, Stratechery, HN Digest, The Browser. Each one is excellent, but I still miss stories relevant to my niche interests.

For example, I care about:
- Rust web frameworks (Axum, Tokio)
- Japanese BJJ athletes
- On-device AI inference
- Product Hunt launch strategies

No single newsletter covers all of this. And even if one did, 90% of each email would be irrelevant.

I wanted a newsletter that adapts to *my* interests, not the editor's.

**The Solution**

News.xyz works like this:

1. **Sign up** and specify your interests (tags, keywords, domains)
2. **AI crawls** 10,000+ sources every 6 hours (RSS, HN, Reddit, Twitter, news sites)
3. **Filters & ranks** articles by relevance to your profile
4. **Generates summary** using Claude Sonnet 4.5
5. **Emails you** a personalized digest (daily, weekly, or real-time)

Example: My morning newsletter might include:
- "Axum 0.8 released with improved error handling" (dev.to)
- "Japanese athlete wins IBJJF Worlds" (FloGrappling)
- "Apple M4 benchmarks for LLM inference" (MacRumors)
- "Lessons from 50 Product Hunt launches" (Indie Hackers)

All in one email, all hyper-relevant.

**How It Works**

Fully serverless stack:

- **Crawler**: Cloudflare Workers (every 6 hours)
  - 10K+ RSS feeds, HN, Reddit, Twitter
  - Stores in Cloudflare R2

- **Ranker**: AWS Lambda (Rust)
  - TF-IDF + semantic similarity (OpenAI embeddings)
  - User profile matching
  - Deduplication

- **Generator**: AWS Lambda (Rust)
  - Claude Sonnet 4.5 for summarization
  - Markdown → HTML templating
  - Tone/length adaptation

- **Mailer**: Amazon SES
  - Batch sends to avoid spam filters
  - One-click unsubscribe

**Privacy First**

I'm not selling your data. Revenue comes from subscriptions, not ads.

- No tracking pixels in emails
- No third-party analytics
- No reselling email addresses
- Easy one-click unsubscribe

Your interests profile is used ONLY for ranking articles.

**Traction**

Launched 6 weeks ago:
- 1,200 subscribers
- 350 paying ($5/mo)
- $1,750 MRR
- 78% open rate (2x industry average)
- 12% click-through rate

**Product Hunt Exclusive**

Use code **HACKERNEWS** for 2 months free on Pro tier.

Pro = daily emails, unlimited interests, priority sources.

Normally $5/mo → Free for 2 months.

**Why I Built This**

I've always been a voracious reader. As a kid, I'd read 3-4 books a week. As an adult, that turned into newsletters and RSS feeds.

But information overload is real. I was spending 2 hours/day just triaging my inbox. Skimming subject lines, opening articles, realizing they're not relevant, moving on.

I wanted an AI research assistant who'd do that for me. Read everything, show me only what matters.

News.xyz is that assistant.

**How It's Different**

- **Google Alerts**: Just sends raw links. News.xyz summarizes and ranks.
- **Feedly**: You curate feeds manually. News.xyz auto-discovers sources.
- **Mailbrew**: Similar idea, but no AI summarization. Also shut down.
- **Substack**: Editor chooses topics. News.xyz adapts to you.

**What's Next**

Roadmap:
- Slack/Discord/Telegram delivery (not just email)
- Browser extension (save articles → auto-add to interests)
- Podcast summaries (transcribe → include in newsletter)
- Video summaries (YouTube → article)
- Multi-language support

I'm here all day to answer questions, hear feedback, and chat about AI, newsletters, or information overload. AMA!

### JiuFlow - BJJ Database

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → Features → Data Quality → Community → Offer → Personal Story → Ask

**Word Count**: 650 words

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Yuki, and I built JiuFlow – a comprehensive database of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu athletes, techniques, and lineage. Think "IMDb for BJJ" or "Basketball Reference for grappling."

**The Problem**

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art/sport with:
- 5 million+ practitioners worldwide
- Thousands of professional competitors
- Rich technical vocabulary (hundreds of techniques)
- Deep lineage culture (who taught whom matters)

But there's no central database. Information is scattered across:
- BJJ Heroes (incomplete)
- FloGrappling (paywalled, video-focused)
- Wikipedia (spotty)
- Instagram bios (unreliable)

I wanted a single source of truth.

**The Solution**

JiuFlow provides:

**1. Athlete Profiles** (100+ and growing)
- Biography & career highlights
- Competition results (IBJJF, ADCC, etc.)
- Lineage (instructors, students)
- Signature techniques
- Social links, photos, videos

Example: Gordon Ryan's profile shows:
- 3x ADCC Champion
- Trained by John Danaher & Garry Tonon
- Known for: Inside heel hook, back control
- Students: Nicky Rod, Ethan Crelinsten

**2. Technique Library** (500+ techniques)
- Categorized by position, type, difficulty
- Step-by-step descriptions
- Video tutorials (embedded from YouTube)
- Common counters
- Athletes known for each technique

Example: "Berimbolo" shows:
- Invented by Mendes Brothers
- Used by Miyao Brothers, Musumeci
- 10+ tutorial videos
- Counters: Smash pass, sit-through

**3. Lineage Trees**
- Visual family trees of instructor-student relationships
- Example: Mitsuyo Maeda → Carlos Gracie → Helio → Rolls → Romero...
- Interactive SVG with zoom/pan
- Click any node to see that person's profile

**4. Match Database** (coming soon)
- Searchable archive of results
- Who fought whom, when, result
- Video links when available
- Answer questions like "Who has Gordon Ryan lost to?"

**Tech Stack**

Built with:
- Rust (Axum framework)
- Askama (type-safe templates)
- Supabase (Postgres)
- Fly.io (hosting)
- Cloudflare (CDN)

Why Rust for a website? Speed. Pages load in <100ms. Zero runtime errors.

**Data Quality**

I'm obsessive about accuracy:
- Cross-reference 3+ sources before publishing
- Reach out to athletes for verification
- Allow athletes to claim & edit their profiles
- Community can suggest corrections (manual review)

~80% automated scraping, 20% manual curation.

**Privacy & Consent**

All profiles are of public figures (professional competitors). But I still:
- Let athletes claim their profile (verify via Instagram)
- Allow them to edit bio, add content, remove errors
- Remove profiles if requested (happened twice)

**Traction**

Launched 4 weeks ago:
- 100 athlete profiles
- 500+ techniques
- 2,000 monthly visitors
- Featured on r/bjj (500+ upvotes)
- Positive feedback from pros (Mikey Musumeci retweeted!)

**Product Hunt Exclusive**

For PH users who are BJJ athletes:

**Claim your profile and get a verified badge free for life.**

Normally $10/mo, free for PH community. Email me: yuki@jiuflow.com with "PH Athlete" in subject.

**Why I Built This**

I've trained BJJ for 10 years. It's my passion outside of coding.

But the sport's online presence is fragmented. Want to learn a technique? Watch 5 different YouTube videos with conflicting info. Want to research an athlete? Check BJJ Heroes, Instagram, FloGrappling, Wikipedia.

I wanted one place with all the information, properly organized, community-verified.

JiuFlow is that place.

**What's Next**

Roadmap:
- Match database (10K+ results)
- Team profiles (Atos, Alliance, Gracie Barra)
- Event coverage (live IBJJF/ADCC updates)

## Chris Messina Specific Template

Chris Messina (@chrismessina) is a major influencer with 1M+ followers. He's hunted 50+ products. He responds well to:
- Innovation in UX/AI
- Privacy-focused products
- Well-designed interfaces
- Personal stories

**Customized Message for Chris:**

```
Subject: PH hunt request - Elio (offline AI for iPhone)

Hi Chris,

I'm Yuki, maker of Elio – a fully offline AI assistant for iPhone. No internet, no servers, no API costs.

I've been following your work on conversational UI and AI for years (your tweets on ChatGPT's UX in late 2022 were spot-on). I think you'd appreciate what we've built.

**What makes it interesting:**
- Entire LLM runs on-device (3B params, 4-bit quantized)
- 15-20 tokens/sec on iPhone 14 Pro using Metal
- Privacy by architecture (can't leak data that never leaves device)
- One-time purchase, no subscription dark patterns

**Why now:**
Model compression + Apple Silicon made this practical in 2024. On-device AI is finally viable.

**What I've prepared:**
Full launch package (5 screenshots, 60s video, detailed first comment, 200+ supporter list).

Launching Wednesday, March 15. Would you consider hunting it?

Happy to send preview link + answer questions.

Best,
Yuki

## Ryan Hoover Specific Template

Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) is the Product Hunt founder. He hunts very rarely now (focused on Weekend Fund VC work). But when he does, it's a major signal.

**Customized Message for Ryan:**

```
Subject: PH hunt request - ChatWeb (agentic AI assistant)

Hi Ryan,

I'm Yuki, maker of ChatWeb – an AI assistant with web search, code execution, and multi-step agentic reasoning.

I know you're incredibly busy with Weekend Fund, but I wanted to reach out because I think this is the kind of product PH was made for: early-stage, innovative, built by a solo maker, addresses a real problem.

**What it does:**
Think "ChatGPT + tools + planning ability." Users can ask multi-step questions like "find cheapest 4K monitor and calculate price with tax" and ChatWeb actually does it (search → fetch → calculate → answer).

**Traction:**
- 500 users in 2 months
- $200 MRR (early!)
- Featured on BetaList, Indie Hackers
- Built entirely on serverless (Lambda + Rust)

**Why I'm reaching out:**
Your essay "Does Product Hunt Still Work?" (2023) resonated deeply. You wrote: "PH works if you ship something genuinely useful and engage authentically."

That's what I'm trying to do. ChatWeb solves a real problem (AI assistants are great at talking, bad at doing), and I'm committed to engaging with every comment, question, and piece of feedback.

Would you consider hunting it?

Launching Wednesday, March 15.

Best,
Yuki

## Josh Howarth Specific Template

Josh Howarth (@joshahoward) runs Exploding Topics. He's very active on PH and hunts products related to data, trends, and AI.

**Customized Message for Josh:**

```
Subject: PH hunt request - News.xyz (personalized AI newsletter)

Hi Josh,

I'm Yuki, maker of News.xyz – an AI-powered newsletter that generates personalized news summaries.

Given your work with Exploding Topics, I thought you might appreciate this: it's essentially "trend tracking + AI summarization + hyper-personalization."

**How it works:**
- Users specify interests (tags, keywords, domains)
- AI crawls 10K+ sources every 6 hours
- Ranks articles by relevance to user profile
- Generates custom summary newsletter

**Why it's interesting:**
- 78% open rate (2x industry avg)
- $1,750 MRR in 6 weeks
- Fully serverless (Cloudflare Workers + Lambda + Rust)
- Privacy-first (no tracking, no reselling emails)

**Why I'm reaching out:**
I've used Exploding Topics for market research on this product. Your tool showed "AI newsletter" as a breakout trend (+300% search volume YoY). You called it right!

Would you consider hunting News.xyz on Product Hunt?

Targeting Wednesday, March 15 for launch.

Happy to send preview + answer questions.

Best,
Yuki

## Self-Hunt Strategy (If No Hunter Responds)

**Don't panic!** 80% of successful launches are self-hunted. Here's how to do it right:

### Optimize Your Maker Profile

- [ ] Professional headshot (not logo)
- [ ] Bio: "Maker of [Product 1], [Product 2]. Building [mission]."
- [ ] Link to Twitter, personal site
- [ ] Add previous products (builds credibility)

### Launch Post Strategy

- [ ] **Be authentic in First Comment**
  - Start with "Hey Product Hunt, I'm [name], maker of [product]"
  - Emphasize personal story ("Why I built this")
  - Be vulnerable (share challenges, learnings)
  - Ask for feedback explicitly

- [ ] **Engage immediately**
  - Reply to first 10 comments within 5 minutes
  - Thank every upvote/comment
  - Be present all day (16+ hours)

- [ ] **Share milestones**
  - "Just hit #10, thank you PH!"
  - "Blown away by the feedback, implementing [feature] based on your suggestions"
  - Builds FOMO + social proof

### Common Self-Hunt Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Ask for upvotes directly ("please upvote") ← against PH rules
- Ghost your launch (reply to comments!)
- Be salesy in replies (be helpful, not pushy)
- Launch on Monday/Friday/weekend (low traffic)
- Submit at wrong time (12:01 AM PST is optimal)

**Do:**
- Be transparent (mention you're the maker)
- Engage authentically
- Answer every question thoroughly
- Share behind-the-scenes
- Thank everyone repeatedly

---

## Final Tips

### Do's
- **Start small**: Launch one product first, learn, then launch the others
- **Be authentic**: PH community values genuineness over slick marketing
- **Engage relentlessly**: Reply to every comment, thank everyone
- **Ship fast**: Fix bugs/add features during launch week
- **Document**: Write a post-mortem, share learnings

### Don'ts
- **Don't buy upvotes**: PH detects this, you'll get banned
- **Don't spam**: One post per product, don't repost unless major update
- **Don't ghost**: If you launch and disappear, community notices
- **Don't oversell**: Be honest about limitations
- **Don't launch on bad days**: Avoid Mon/Fri/weekends

### Mindset
- **It's a marathon, not a sprint**: PH launch is Day 1, not the finish line
- **Feedback > Rank**: Top 10 with great feedback beats #1 with no comments
- **Community > Traffic**: Build relationships, not just drive clicks
- **Learn > Win**: Every launch teaches you something, success or not

## Recommended Launch Order

Given your 4 products, I'd recommend:

**Week 1: ChatWeb**
- Most mature (500 users, $200 MRR)
- Broadest appeal (everyone uses AI)
- Good learning opportunity

**Week 3: Elio**
- Strong differentiation (offline AI)
- Appeals to privacy-conscious devs
- Viral potential (unique tech)

**Week 5: News.xyz**
- Strong traction ($1,750 MRR)
- Clear value prop
- Easy to demo

**Week 7: JiuFlow**
- Niche audience (BJJ community)
- Test community-driven launch
- Lower pressure (niche = lower expectations)

**Why 2 weeks between launches?**
- Time to implement feedback from previous launch
- Avoid audience fatigue
- Each launch informs the next
